        <p><b>Description:</b> Having lived and written in China for more than three decades, acclaimed author and journalist Peter Hessler offers a rare, ground-level perspective on how ordinary lives illuminate broader social and cultural change. This conversation explores his recent experiences in China, reflections on education and social mobility in both countries, and insights from his new book Other Rivers. Through these stories, Peter and the discussants will reflect on how cultural writing and personal narratives can bridge understanding between two societies often seen in opposition, yet deeply connected through shared human experience.</p>
